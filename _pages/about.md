I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Optimization & Machine Learning (OptiML) Laboratory at Kim Jaechul Graduate School of AI, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST AI), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chulhee Yun](https://chulheeyun.github.io/).
Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in AI at KAIST and B.E. in Cyber Security (minor in Mathematics) at Korea University.

## Research Interests
I am interested in deep learning theory, particularly the theoretical foundations of large language models (LLMs). I am also actively exploring topics in multi-armed bandits and optimization.
